description: Update documentation about shared library and components.
---

Check the codes in @src/lib/ and @src/components/ and update the following documentation files:
- @docs/lib-catalog.md - documentation about shared libraries in src/lib/
- @docs/components-catalog.md - documentation about components in src/components/
- @CLAUDE.md - overview of the project

Note: For components directory, only document the top-level components, not the sub-components. For example, src/components/OTPInputField/Scanner.tsx is just a part of src/components/OTPInputField/index.tsx, so you don't need to document them separately.
